    "Imagine you are playing Tennis,and you just hit a forehand from the back corner, where the baseline meets the sideline of the tennis court. Now, assume your opponent has countered with a drop shot (one that would place the ball short with little forward momentum) to the opposite corner, where the other sideline meets the net. Write a programme to determine how far must you run to reach the ball so that you don't miss the shot?\n",
