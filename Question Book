Create a calculator in python using if else elif statement. Acknowledge the fact that division by 0 is not allowed.
Swap the number without using third variable and Swap the number with a third variable.
Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the string in reverse order.
Write a Program to extract each digit from an integer in the reverse order. For example, If the given int is 7536, the output shall be “6 3 5 7“, with a space separating the digits.
Write a program to check if the given number is a palindrome number.
Write a program that will tell whether the given number is divisible by 3 & 6.
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle. The program should then calculate and display the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.
Write a program which prompts the user to enter a sentence and then checks if a word exists in that sentence.
Suppose you have a book with a total of 1200 pages, and each chapter in the book consists of 66 pages. Write a Python program that calculates and displays the total number of chapters in the book.
You have a list of fruits: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "apricot", "custard apple", "grapes"]. Write a Python program that iterates through each fruit in the list and displays both the fruit name and its individual characters.
Write a Python program that asks the user whether it is day or night. Depending on the response, the program will prompt for an activity choice. If it is daytime, the program will offer options to play outside, read a book, or take a nap. If it is nighttime, the program will suggest sleeping and resting.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer and then prints the countdown from that number to 1. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should print "5, 4, 3, 2, 1".

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then calculates and prints the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to that number (inclusive). For example, if the user enters 8, the program should calculate the sum of 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 and output the result.
Write a Python program that takes a three-digit number as input from the user and calculates the sum of its individual digits. For example, if the user enters 354, the program should output the sum of 3, 5, and 4, which is 12.

Consider a list of numbers: list1 = [12,564,654,4,56,487,1,468,98,654,897,8974,684,987,684,87,654,6587,68,48]
Write a Python program that counts the number of elements in the list that are divisible by 5. The program should iterate through each element in the list and increment a counter (divisible_count) for each element that is divisible by 5. Finally, the program should display the total count of such elements.
Write a program which takes an input from the the user as an integer and prints if the number is even or odd.
#Using a for loop, can you print the numbers from 1 to 10?
Using a for loop in python, and range function write a program that only prints every third number from the user input. For example if the user inputs 5 so the output should be 5,8,11 and so on.
Suppose you have two lists: adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"] and fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]. Write a Python program that generates combinations of adjectives from the adj list with fruits from the fruits list. The program should iterate through each adjective and each fruit, and print out the combination of an adjective and a fruit on separate lines.
# Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. The program should calculate and display the sum of all the digits in that number.For example, if the user enters 1234, the program should calculate the sum as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Write the code to implement this program using a while loop.
Consider a positive integer numb = 987654321. Write a Python program that extracts and prints each digit of the given number on separate lines. The program should use a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number, print it, and then remove the last digit by integer division. The process should continue until all the digits of the number have been extracted and printed.
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and prints the number of words in the sentence. Assume that words in the sentence are separated by spaces. Then using the same sentence the program prints the number of letter in the sentence excluding spaces. 
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and prints the number of vowels in the sentence.Consider vowels to be the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
Write a program that asks the user to guess a secret number. The program should keep prompting the user for guesses until they correctly guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the program should print a congratulatory message.
